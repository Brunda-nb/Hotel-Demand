# 🏨 Hotel Booking Analytics Project

## 🎯 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze hotel booking data to uncover patterns that drive revenue, occupancy, and cancellations.  
It uses an end-to-end data pipeline — from data extraction and cleaning to analytics, visualization, and business insights.  
The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle: Hotel Booking Demand](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand).

## 💼 Business Objective
To help hotel management teams understand key factors influencing:
- Revenue growth
- Occupancy rates
- Customer loyalty
- Booking cancellations

---

## 💡 Business Questions

### 1️⃣ Revenue & Profitability
**Question:**  
> What factors most influence the hotel’s Average Daily Rate (ADR) and overall revenue?

**Goal:**  
Identify how hotel type, season, and market segment affect room pricing and profitability.

**Possible Insights:**  
- Resort Hotels may show higher ADRs in summer months.  
- Online Travel Agencies might generate higher bookings but lower profitability.

---

### 2️⃣ Booking Behavior
**Question:**  
> How does lead time (days booked in advance) impact cancellations and occupancy?

**Goal:**  
Analyze the relationship between how early guests book and the likelihood of cancellation or occupancy rate.

**Possible Insights:**  
- Longer lead times might lead to higher cancellations.  
- Shorter lead times may indicate last-minute travelers with higher conversion rates.

---

### 3️⃣ Customer Segmentation & Loyalty
**Question:**  
> Who are our most valuable customers — and how can we increase repeat bookings?

**Goal:**  
Segment guests based on booking history, geography, and market segment.

**Possible Insights:**  
- Repeat guests often come through direct or corporate channels.  
- Families and couples have different booking behaviors and lead times.

---

### 4️⃣ Market Channel Performance
**Question:**  
> Which booking channels and market segments bring the most profitable guests?

**Goal:**  
Evaluate the performance of each channel (e.g., Direct, Corporate, Online TA).

**Possible Insights:**  
- Direct bookings could have higher ADR and lower cancellation rates.  
- OTA channels might drive volume but at lower margins due to commissions.

---

### 5️⃣ Operational Optimization
**Question:**  
> What factors drive booking cancellations, and how can we reduce them?

**Goal:**  
Determine key predictors of cancellations and recommend data-driven actions.

**Possible Insights:**  
- Non-refundable deposits reduce cancellations significantly.  
- Certain months show high cancellation peaks due to seasonal behavior.

---

### 6️⃣ Seasonality & Forecasting
**Question:**  
> How do seasonal trends affect occupancy and revenue — and can we forecast demand?

**Goal:**  
Understand monthly booking patterns and forecast future demand.

**Possible Insights:**  
- High booking trends in Q2 and Q3 (summer season).  
- Forecast models can predict next quarter’s occupancy and ADR.
